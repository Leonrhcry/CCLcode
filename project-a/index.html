                Through previous research, we have discovered that the dark zone expanded by SCP-XXXX will disappear after some time. 
                Light source not only provide it with energy, but also makes it evolve. SCP-XXXX is aggressive after absorbing light.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Providing light sources with different intensity will make SCP-XXXX have distinct transformation. 
                Press the button next to each light bulb, wait for SCP-XXXX changing its shape or behavior.
                However, it is not a suggested option, since SCP-XXXX needs to be contained within a 10cm x 10cm reinforced containment cube composed of non-reflective, high-density alloy.
